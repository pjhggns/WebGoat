=== HTTP POST
Requests that will change the state of the application, such as
updating the user database as implemented with POST.
Look in the proxy to examine the http request.
You will see the  string you entered, as a query parameter
to the POST request.
But there may be some differences, for example spaces are replaced
by plus symbols. This is called url-form-encoded format.
Sometimes this is imprecisely called "url encoded".
The underlying encoding is to replace characters
with the hex representation preceded by a percent sign %
so it is also called per-cent-encoding.

In addition to spaces, url encoding also replaces
some other characters, for example, some special sequences
are:

* <bold>
* &copy;

Look at the HTTTP request and note the format of a POST
request. Note the headers for content-type and for
content-length. There is no content-length header in a get request,
because there is no body content.
