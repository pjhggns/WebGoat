=== MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE ATTACK

We looked at HTTP get and post requests and encoding.
This assignment is to perform a small man-in-the-middle
attack, and change a request using the proxy.

This is an extreme example of an intruder gaining access
to communications. It could happen, for example,
using a malicious counterfeit wireless "free" public-access
hub. But even in a browser-server environment there are
many agents between the user and the server.

Set a breakpoint in your proxy,
Enter a string below, and submit it.
Your string must include some UTF-8 multibyte sequences
or other escaped characters (spaces, punctuation).

Change the request from a GET to a POST.
