== HTTP ENCODING MULTIPART
There are how many encoding methods used for HTTP requests,
such as jpeg, bmp, etc. You may encounter or manipulate
many of these in the context of security.

So far, the HTTP requests have included only single part
forms, that were all encoded using url-for-encoding.
Another method is to send multipart forms, which allow
a mixture of encodings in the request.

Also, we will see a couple of new encodings. One of the more
common encodings foun is Base64, allwoing binary data.
Another format is UTF-16.

Enter some numbers into the form below, and the Base64
will be calculated.
