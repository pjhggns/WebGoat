=== Encryption and Man in the Middle

Revisiting the Man-in-the-middle attack, encryption
and hashing can help.

Enter your sensitive string and it will be sent
as plain text and and encrypted text, and with
a hash on the plain text to provide message integrity.
 Of course a real application would never send the
 plain text and the encrypted text.

Now if you change the fields the software will
 detect it. This approach is similar to older secure
 connection techniques, but by itself it does not provide very
 good security for a number of reasons and should only be used
 in conjunction with SSL.

 Note that the code is using a "nonce" as a hash.

 Try it. Enter a string and try to change any of the
 data that is sent.
