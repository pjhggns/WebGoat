== HTTP PUT
Look in the proxy to examine the http request.
You will see the  string you entered, as a query parameter
to the PUT request.
But there may be some differences, for example spaces are replaced
by plus symbols. This is called url-form-encoded format.
Sometimes this is imprecisely called "url encoded".
The underlying encoding is to replace characters
with the hex representation preceded by a percent sign %
so it is also called per-cent-encoding.

In addition to spaces, url encoding also replaces
some other characters, for example, some special sequences
are:
- 1
- 2

Look at the HTTTPmrequest and note the format of a PUT
request. Note the headers for content-type and for
content-lenght. There is no content-length header in a get,
because there is no body content.
