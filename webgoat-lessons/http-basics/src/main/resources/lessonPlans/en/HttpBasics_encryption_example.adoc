=== Encryption example
In this example is shown encryption and hashing.
Enter a message, and the message is sent to the
server in plaintext, ??? encrypted, and SHA-256
hash signature.

Try It!
Capture the request in proxy and alter the message.
You will see the altered message when received
but the encrypted and the hash will not match
and the code will detect it.

Can you change the hash to match? Not without
knowing the key (which is in the browser code,
so not too hard to find it).

This technique can help prevent man in the middle
type attackes, which also includes attacks on
stored data. All sensitive data stored on
the file system should be encrypted.

Enter a string and submit it. The code will
send the string encrypted and also send a
salted hash. Try changing the request data,
and note that the server will detect that it had
been changed.
